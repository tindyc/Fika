## Objective:


In the Swedish culture, the word fika encompasses many meanings. It has been described as, a concept, a state of mind, and, an attitude. It is the act of consciously taking time in your day to meet with friends or colleagues to share a beverage and have something to eat. Fika has become a daily practive in Sweden, so much so that businesses have adpoted this into their daily running. 

In today’s busy world, time slips away before we realise it. It’s easy to get caught up and miss out on spending time with friends and family. 
By using our platform, we hope it will help users stay connected with their friends and family by encouraging them to make time for themself and those valuable experiences with others. 

The three main objectives are;

* ### To give users the power to connect with friends and family.
    Our plan is to help users support and build on relationships they already have with friends and family. This is done by encouraging them to plan and create events that they want to experience with their friends.
* ### To help prevent loneliness and isolation.
    Whether it is a pandemic or a busy lifestyle, loneliness can affect anyone. We want you to reach out to people you already know to help support you. Our platform will give you the power and a voice to do this, by joining or creating an event in your circle of friends whenever you feel out of touch with them.
* ### To encourage you to get up and do something!
    Our platform is based on the creation of events. They can be as big or as small, as elaborate or as simple as you want them to be. The important thing is that you engage and connect with people and make it part of your routine.


## User Experience (UX):

* ### Target Audience

    * Users that are looking for a platform for connecting family members and friends. 
    * Users that are looking to plan events and invite their friends and family.

  * #### Returning Visitor Goals
